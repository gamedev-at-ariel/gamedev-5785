## Introduction
In this repository we will explain how to build conversation trees and a split plot 
using Twine.
After building the plot we will see how all the information we created can be 
transferred into Unity.

We created a game that contains a conversation between knight and farmer.
The knight need to choose his path, if the knight agree to help he will get a quest to kill
a robber, if the quest is complete the farmer will give the knight gold! :moneybag:

#### About Twine
Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.
You don't need to write any code to create a simple story with Twine, but you can extend your stories with variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript when you're ready.

Twine publishes directly to HTML, so you can post your work nearly anywhere.
 Anything you create with it is completely free to use any way you like, including for commercial purposes.

#### About Cradle
An editor plugin that imports Wtine stories into Unity. 
Cradle offers a clean, straightforward system for adding story-related code to a game, keeping it separate from other game code and ensuring that changes to the narrative flow and structure can be done with minimal hassle.
